Hello, I'm a 31-year-old student, mother, and proud Texas native. I hail from the generation that honed its gaming skills on "Snake" using a Nokia brick phone, and later witnessed the spectacle of billionaires venturing into space. The wealth of experiences ingrained in me by this generational advantage has propelled me to become a well-rounded individual with a keen interest in all things tech.

My professional journey began in sales and residential property management, where I navigated the intricacies of business strategy to thrive in a fiercely competitive real estate market. My aptitude for driving revenue and educating others on effective methodologies propelled me to successfully complete, master, and graduate from the Business Intelligence Analytics program offered by Tripletenâ€”an award-winning bootcamp renowned for its tech-focused curriculum. My latest proficiencies include SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. Currently, I am actively seeking full-time employment, externships, and opportunities to further my education while showcasing my artistic and analytical talents.

As I immerse myself in the tech industry, I seek collaboration with like-minded individualsâ€”artistic minds, passionate hearts, and open-minded professionalsâ€”who are committed to making a data-driven difference in companies, regardless of their size. Armed with my knowledge and proficient sales skills, I am poised to make impactful business decisions that leave a lasting impression.

Amidst my professional growth, I remain dedicated to my academic pursuits at Houston Community College, where I am an active member and scholar of the National Honor Societyâ€”an exclusive organization recognizing students for their outstanding academic achievements and leadership qualities. My sights are set on entering the B.S. Computer Science program at the University of Houston in the Spring of 2026.

I hope to leave you inspired and motivated to pursue your own path to success.

Remember, "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
