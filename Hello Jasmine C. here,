- Hello. I am a 31 year old student, mother, and a proud Texas Native. I grew up in the generation that played "Snake" on a Nokia brick phone, then watched billionaires enter space. The amount of experience this generational advantage has instilled in me has pushed me to be a worldly woman with interests in all things tech.

My passion: Meteorology
My dream job: Weather Anchor
My brain: IBM ;)

My professional background is in sales and residential property management. In this field of work, I witnessed the ins and outs of business strategy to increase financial gain in a highly competitive real estate market. My knack for generating revenue, and educating others on my methods in this field, led me to successfully complete, master, and graduate from the Business Intelligence Analytics program by Tripleten, an award winning bootcamp for all things tech. My newest proefficencies are in SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. I am currently seeking full time employment, externships, and opportunities that will further my education and showcase my artistic and analytical talents.

As I embark on my deep dive into the tech industry, I look to collaborate with artistic minds, passionate hearts, and open minded professionals, willing to make a data-driven difference in companies big or small. I intend to use my knowledge and proefficient sales skills to earn my place in the industry to make business decisions that create a lasting impact. 
In the midst of all this professional growth, I focus my brainpower on academics at Houston Community College. I am a current member and scholar of the National Honor Society, an invitation only organization for students recognized to have great academic achievement and leadership power. I am determined to enter the B.S Computer Science program at University of Houston in the Spring of 2026.

I hope you leave here inspired and motivated to achieve success.
